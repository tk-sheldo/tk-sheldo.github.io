		<p>My girlfriend and I spent the Fall of 2020 on a small farm outside of Selma, Oregon, about a 30 minute drive from the California border. For two months, we split firewood, laid irrigation pipe, and planted greenhouse seedlings. We worked closely with Curtis, one of our hosts. Among a million other things, Curtis taught us cob construction, building enduring structures out of mud and straw.</p>
		<p>The cob mixture can be finicky, and it behaves differently depending on moisture content and the mud-straw ratio. It was challenging, and a ton of fun. A big thanks to Curtis and Patricia for sharing their knowledge and their home.</p>
