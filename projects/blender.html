		<p>In the Fall of 2017, a friend and I worked together on a project for the Middlebury Animation Studio, building computer tools to assist animators with several sequences that would become part of the short film <i>Estrellita</i>. The two of us were primarily focused on one shot of a mountain collapsing, where animators had run into unexpected difficulties using existing tools to animate fractured meshes.</p>
		<p>Blender, the open-source 3D modeling and animation software used by the Middlebury Animaiton Studio, boasts an active community of modders. Several add-ons offered tools that could 'shatter' a mesh, but the resutling shards would not inherit animation data, resulting in an apparent loss of inertia.</p>

		<p>After some tinkering within Blenders standard user interface, we wrote a script that would copy over animation data from the original mesh to its' fractured descendants. A fuller description of the intricacies of that process can be found <a href="../media/cs500_write_up.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p>The Middlebury Animation Studio is a small community, and is only able to produce the films it does through a strong collaborative ethic. In my time there, I was constantly learning new roles, sharing desk space and critical feedback with a variety of digital artists. It was a truly interdisciplinary team, and a community as well. I loved being a part of it. You can see our fracture modifier in action about four minutes into the video, but you should really watch the whole thing.</p>
